Name: Mike Loncaric

Bio: A scientist turned data scientist.

Goals: Learn SQL, build better models, and discover new tools for data analysis.

Bayesian statistics is my preferred approach over frequentist statistics. Here’s a helpful article:

Classical data science analysis is crucial for inference, which enables storytelling. However, I believe it’s better to approach data analysis from the storytelling perspective.

For instance, let’s consider the example of Napoleon’s disastrous decision to march his army to Moscow during the winter. This decision had profound consequences, leading to the near-destruction of his army. By analyzing the data, we can gain insights into the factors that contributed to Napoleon’s folly and the devastating effects of his choices.

conclusion... Dont invade russia in the winter!
