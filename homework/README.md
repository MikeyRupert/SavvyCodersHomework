Bio: A scientist turned data scientist.

Goals: Learn SQL, build better models, and discover new tools for data analysis.

Bayesian statistics is my preferred approach over frequentist statistics. Here’s a helpful article:

Classical data science analysis ---> Inference Enables Storytelling; Frequentist approach, Data goes to story ; DATA ----> STORY

Napoleon’s disastrous decision to march his army to Moscow during the winter. Napoleon ego lead to his dimise when he led his army to near-destruction. long freq values

Bayes Theorem and probabilistic programming Monte Carlo ----> Storytelling enables inference; Bayesian approach;  Story goes to data ; STORY ----> DATA
we want to quantify uncertainty, incorporate priors and new evidence that might have told napoleon to stay home
